## Short-Term Forecast  Description

Our short-term model is a statistical data-fitting model using a curve-fitting approach. This approach uses a weighted average between an exponential, quadratic, and logistic function to fit a curve to the confirmed COVID case data. These mathematical functions are widely used to capture the different dynamics and phases in a disease outbreak. Stratification of COVID-19 patients was done by specifying the expected proportion of patients to not require critical care, to require critical care, and finally to require critical care and mechanical ventilation. It is assumed that the patient would remain at the hospital for different lengths of time (3-14 days) based on their symptom severity. 
 


## Intervention Model 

The Intervention model extends an existing SEIR model to understand the dynamics of COVID-19. The SEIR model used in this tool adapts the [model](https://alhill.shinyapps.io/COVID19seir/) created by Alison Hill of Harvard University and licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). SEIR models are a primary tool of epidemiology, providing insight into epidemiological dynamics, *but are not well-suited for accurate near-term forecasts given their dependence on parameters that are difficult to estimate and assumptions about population mixing.* 
We have attempted to “fit” transmission characteristics to local areas by finding optimized model parameters that best fit the actual data for COVID-19 *deaths* for a given area; often however, these fits are not satisfactory. 

As you use this tool, keep in mind that the model may not fit observed data. The purpose of these fits is to ensure the model is somewhat accurate to a given area for purposes of What If evaluation of policies.  The structure and assumptions necesary in an SEIR model does not make them well suited to forecasting.  If you desire a forecast, statistical approaches perform better, but are typically only useful in the short term.  A comparison of various forecast models can be found [here](https://reichlab.io/covid19-forecast-hub/).

### Using Model Interventions
  Start by choosing a U.S. state from the top dropdown list. With this, the model is loaded with basic data describing that state, including the population, case history, hospital capacity, and the dates of any NPIs implemented by the state. Each state has different transmission characteristics.After selecting a State to model, select what metrics to graph.  The choices are:
        
* Critical Infections and ICU Bed Capacity
* Critical Infections and Ventilator Capacity
* Cases Needing Hospitalization and Hospital Bed Capacity
* All Infections
* Deaths
        
  
### Inspecting the Graph
The graph to the right plots the modeled value selected under *Data to Show*. The red line indicates the present day, and the purple shaded region is the time period during which NPIs are in place. If the value of the metric being graphed has a very high maximum value in the shown time period, the early numbers may be small and difficult to see. You can click and drag on a region of the chart to zoom in on that area. When you move the cursor over any data line, a tool tip will appear with the values at that date. More viewing options are available in the top right of the graph, such as zooming, panning, resetting the view, and tooltip style.

Underneath the graph is a timeline of NPIs currently in place for a given state, starting on the actual date each went into effect. As most states have not yet announced when NPIs will be lifted, each NPI is kept in place for the duration of the simulation. The length of these NPIs can be changed by dragging the bars to the desired time, and then clicking on the timeline canvas to commit the change. Finer control on data selection can be achieved through the date picker in the NPI tab, described below.

  
### Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions
This tab shows the five primary NPIs used. By default, all NPIs currently in place in that state are selected, beginning on the date they were enacted, and held in place for four months. The dates of each NPI can be changed using the date picker next to the name or the timeline canvas described above. As the NPIs change, the shaded region in the graph will also change.
  
  Currently, the models of NPI effectiveness are rough estimates, chosen based upon observations from Google's [COVID-19 Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/), [SafeGraph's Geographic Response to Shelter in Place](https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-shelter-in-place"), and real world observation. This is an active area of model development, and it is known that different locations have varying levels of effectiveness, and that this effectiveness varies over time.  The model does not yet account for this.

The values for NPIs can be adjusted in the Advanced Model Settings tab if desired.  An NPI with a value of 1.0 would mean that it is 100% effective at reducing contact between people; 0.5 would indicate a 50% reduction.
  
### Health System Capacity
Under the NPI tab, actual state data for hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators, and their average usage is shown. By varying these parameters, e.g., adding more capacity, you can observe the impact this has on the cumulative number of deaths. This data does not currently include information on local field hospitals that have been deployed in response to COVID-19.
  
### Advanced Model Settings
This tab can be found in the left sidebar. In Alison Hill's original model, there are many parameters for the SEIR. We have chosen default values based on current data becoming available, with a bias toward U.S. data. Additionally, we have added more parameters for the effectiveness of NPIs, which can vary. All sources can be found in the Sources tab at the left. When fitting the model to individual states, four parameters were varied: population size, the date of the first case, initial # infected, mild transmission rate, severe transmission rate, and critical transmission rate. Please experiment with different values to build insight, especially for highly known parameters, such as the percentage of asymptomatic carrriers there are in the population.

## Intervention Model Description

![Model flowchart](model_diagram_small.png)

We use a compartmental epidemiological model, based on the classic SEIR model, to describe the spread and clinical progression of COVID-19. A nice primer to this sort of model is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology).  It is important to track the different clinical outcomes of infection, since they require different level of healthcare resources to care for and may be tested and isolated at different rates. Susceptible ($S$) individuals who become infected start out in an exposed class $E$, where they are asymptomatic and do not transmit infection. The rate of progressing from the exposed stage to the infected stage $I$, where the individual is symptomatic and infectious, occurs at rate $a$. The clinical descriptions of the different stages of infection are given below. Infected individuals begin with *mild* infection ($I_1$), from which they either recover, at rate $\gamma_1$, or progress to *severe* infection ($I_2$), at rate $p_1$. Severe infection resolves at rate $\gamma_2$ or progresses to a critical stage ($I_3$) at rate $p_2$. $p_2$ is further adjusted in response to hospital bed capacity being reached. Individuals with critical infection recover at rate $\gamma_3$ and die at rate $\mu$. $\mu$ is further adjusted in response to hospital ventilator capacity being reached. Recovered individuals are tracked by class $R$ and are assumed to be protected from re-infection for life. Individuals may transmit the infection at any stage, though with different rates. The  transmission rate in stage $i$ is described by $\beta_i$ . A new subpopulation for *asymptomatic* infections  ($I_0$) has been added, that only has a recovery rate ($\gamma_0$) and no progression, but can infect anyone via transmission rate $\beta_0$. This will allow modeling of a recently identified group that may explaqin why COVID-19 seems so contagious (see https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/cellphone-tracking-could-help-stem-spread-coronavirus-privacy-price).

* $\beta_0 = \beta_1 * AsymptoCrossSect$ infection rate for asymptomatics scaled relative to $\beta_1$
* $a$ rate of progression from the exposed to infected class
* $a_0$ rate of progression from the exposed to asymptomatic (hidden) infected class

### Clinical stages

* Mild infection - These individuals have symptoms like fever and cough and may have mild pneumonia.  Hospitalization is not required (though in many countries such individuals are also hospitalized)
* Severe infection - These individuals have more severe pneumonia that leads to dyspnea, respiratory frequency <30/min, blood oxygen saturation <93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours. Hospitalization and supplemental oxygen are generally required.
* Critical infection - These individuals experience respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Treatment in an ICU, often with mechanical ventilation, is required.


### Relating clinical observations to model parameters

To determine the model parameters consistent with current clinical data, we collect the following values from the slider values chosen by the user, and then use the formulas below to relate them to the rate parameters in the model. Note that the slider inputs for time intervals are averages durations. 

* IncubPeriod:  Average incubation period, days
* FracAsympto:  % of asymptomatic patients out of first-stage infected-cases
* AsymptoCrossSect: effective scaling of infection rate for asymptomatics relative to $\beta_1$
* DurMildInf: Average duration of mild infections, days
* FracMild: Average fraction of (symptomatic) infections that are mild
* FracSevere: Average fraction of (symptomatic) infections that are severe
* FracCritical: Average fraction of (symptomatic) infections that are critical
* CFR: Case fatality rate (fraction of infections that eventually result in death)
* DurHosp: Average duration of hospitalization for individuals with severe/critical infection, days
* TimeICUDeath: Average time from ICU admission to death, days

\begin{equation}
  a = \frac{1}{IncubPeriod}
\end{equation}

<!-- #g1=(1/DurMildInf)*FracMild -->
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{DurMildInf} * FracMild
\end{equation}

<!-- #p1=(1/DurMildInf)-g1 -->
\begin{equation}
  p_1 = \frac{1}{DurMildInf} - \gamma_1
\end{equation}

<!-- #p2=(1/DurHosp)*(FracCritical/(FracSevere+FracCritical)) -->
\begin{equation}
  p_2 = \frac{1}{DurHosp} * \frac{FracCritical}{(FracSevere+FracCritical)}
\end{equation}

<!-- #g2=(1/DurHosp)-p2 -->
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{DurHosp} - p_2
\end{equation}

<!-- #u=(1/TimeICUDeath)*(CFR/FracCritical) -->
\begin{equation}
  u = \frac{1}{TimeICUDeath} * \frac{CFR}{FracCritical}
\end{equation}

<!-- #g3=(1/TimeICUDeath)-u -->
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_3 = \frac{1}{TimeICUDeath} - u
\end{equation}



### Basic reproductive ratio

Idea: $R_0$ is the sum of 
1. the average number of secondary infections generated from an individual in stage $I_1$
2. the probability that an infected individual progresses to $I_2$ multiplied by the average number of secondary infections generated from an individual in stage $I_2$
3.  the probability that an infected individual progresses to $I_3$ multiplied by the average number of secondary infections generated from an individual in stage $I_3$

\begin{equation}
R_0  = N\frac{\beta_1}{p_1+\gamma_1} + N\frac{\beta_0}{\gamma_0} + \frac{p_1}{p_1 + \gamma_1} \left( \frac{N \beta_2}{p _ \texttt{2\_hc}+\gamma_2} + \frac{p _ \texttt{2\_hc}}{p _ \texttt{2\_hc} + \gamma_2} \frac{N \beta_3}{\mu _ {vc} + \gamma_3}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 = N\left( \frac{\beta_0}{\gamma_0} + \frac{\beta_1}{p_1+\gamma_1} \left(1 + \frac{p_1}{p _ \texttt{2\_hc} + \gamma_2}\frac{\beta_2}{\beta_1} \left( 1 + \frac{p _ \texttt{2\_hc}}{\mu _ {vc} + \gamma_3} \frac{\beta_3}{\beta_2} \right) \right) \right)
\end{equation}

Calculations using the next generation matrix give the same results. 

### Early epidemic growth rate

Early in the epidemic, before susceptibles are depleted, the epidemic grows at an exponential rate $r$, which can also be described with doubling time T$_2$=ln(2)$/r$. During this phase all infected classes grow at the same rate.

### Assumptions

* This model is formulated as a system of differential equations and the output therefore represents the expected values of each quantity. It does not take into account stochastic events or report the expected variance in the variables, which can be large. 
* Individuals must pass through a mild stage before reaching a severe or critical stage
* Individuals must pass through a severe stage before reaching a critical stage
* Only individuals in a critical stage die
* Asymptomatic individuals do not progress further and can only be identified using PCR or antibody testing
