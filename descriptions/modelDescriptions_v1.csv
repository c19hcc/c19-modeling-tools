C19HCC Short-term,A simple ensemble curve-fitting approach.,,The model is tuned to fit real data but projections are likely not accurate beyond 4-5 weeks,mitre_curve
C19HCC Ensemble,"An ensemble model that projects future cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by averaging predictions from three smaller models: a policy-based SEIR model, a mobility-based SEIR model, and a statistical curve-fitting model.",Ensemble methods tend to be less extreme and closer to the actual future values; This method blends both statistical curve-fitting models with traditional epidemiological models to leverage the comparative strengths of both,,mitre_ens
Penn CHIME,Built for a single hospital;  Here we expand it to a state using the data of first case for that state;  Assumed social distancing of 85% for these runs,Tailored views for hospitals needs and forecasts,"This model is initialized with data as best as we are able, but has not been curve fit using actual data; Assumes constant, single social distancing value.",chime
Harvard,"Loaded model with the population, first date of confirmed infection, and hospital resources for a given state; Assumed Social distancing of 85%",Many exposed parameters to build understanding of impacts.,"This model is initialized with data as best as we are able, but has not been curve fit using actual data; Currently, impact of NPIs is a single input.",harvard
IHME,Applies a hybrid Curve-fitting/SEIR approach to take into account current actions.  Considered by many the leading model.,Statistical model which attempts to fit curves from China and Italy onto US States.,There are no public parameters for this model;  this is intended to be their best public estimate.,ihme
MITRE SD,"Initialized with state data; Assumed Social distancing of 85%, Public health campaigns, and PPE availability.","Captures many potential feedback loops, including bed shortages, provider shortages, and material shortages.",,mitre_sd

Columbia University,These models are based on assumptions about how levels of social distancing will change in the future; All start by assuming a weekly 20%/30%/40% reduction in the contact rate for each week when the epidemic growth rate is increasing.,,,cu_60

Georgia Tech,This model assumes that the effects of interventions are reflected in the observed data and will continue going forward.,,,georgia_tech
LANL,"Currently implemented interventions and the corresponding reductions in transmission will continue, resulting in an overall decrease in the growth rate of COVID-19; Over the course of the forecast, the model assumes that the growth will decrease over time.",,,lanl
MIT,The projections assume that current interventions will remain in place indefinitely.,,,mit
Northeastern (MOBS),The projections assume that social distancing policies in place at the date of calibration are extended for the future weeks.,,,mobs
Notre Dame,The model accounts for individual state€™s school-closure and stay-at-home policies,,,notredame
UCLA,These projections do not make any specific assumptions about which interventions have been or will remain in place.,,,ucla
University of Geneva,The projections assume that social distancing policies in place at the date of calibration are extended for the future weeks.,Statistical fit using either exponential or linear model to better match recent growth rate of cumulative deaths,,geneva
UMass Amherst,These projections do not make any specific assumptions about which interventions have been or will remain in place.,,,umass
UT Austin,Estimates the extent of social distancing using geolocation data from mobile phones; Assumes that the extent of social distancing does not change during the period of forecasting; The model is designed to predict confirmed COVID-19 deaths resulting from only a single wave of transmission.,,,austin
Youyang Gu,The model accounts for individual state-by-state re-openings and the resulting effects on infections and deaths.,,,yyg
